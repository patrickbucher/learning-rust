Having neither found the motivation for Angular/TypeScript on one hand and for
Haskell on the other hand, I'd like to dive into Rustâ€”once more, and once and
for all! Having almost wasted the first quarter of this year by dipping into
Erlang, Haskell, TypeScript and Angular using different material, I'd like to
focus the next quarter on Rust entirely. Working with the Rust type system and
reading the Rust compiler's error messages will bring me a step closer to
Haskell, which I'd like to approach once more in the second half of the year.
But for now Rust seems to be the perfect compromise between difficulty,
practicality, and long-time reward.
