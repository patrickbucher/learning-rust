# Day 1 (2024-03-25)

I re-read chapter 1 of _The Rust Programming Language_—both in the paperback and
in the Brown University version, which look identical to me. I also started with
rustlings, of which I did the first two. I wanted to start exercise 1 _Saying
Hello_ in _Exercises for Programmers_, but since this requires user input, I
have to postpone it after having read chapter 2 of the book.

As an aside, I followed the suggestion from the _No Boilerplate_ video on
how to learn Rust and started reading _Ultralearning_ as a side quest.

# Day 0 (2024-03-24)

Having neither found the motivation for Angular/TypeScript on one hand and for
Haskell on the other hand, I'd like to dive into Rust—once more, and once and
for all! Having almost wasted the first quarter of this year by dipping into
Erlang, Haskell, TypeScript and Angular using different material, I'd like to
focus the next quarter on Rust entirely. Working with the Rust type system and
reading the Rust compiler's error messages will bring me a step closer to
Haskell, which I'd like to approach once more in the second half of the year.
But for now Rust seems to be the perfect compromise between difficulty,
practicality, and long-time reward.
