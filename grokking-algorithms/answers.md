## 1.1

`log2(128) = 7`

## 1.2

For O(log n), the number of operations just increases by one as the input size
doubles.

`log2(2*128) = log2(256) = 8`

## 1.3

O(n) for linear search, O(log n) for binary search

## 1.4

O(n) for linear search

## 1.5

O(n) for linear search

## 1.6

O(n) for linear search; even though 'A' roughly covers 1/26 of the alphabet, the
constant factor 1/26 isn't relevant for the algorithm's order.
