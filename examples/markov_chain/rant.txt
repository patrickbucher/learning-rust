I am sick and tired of those degenerate illiterates that incessantly talk about artificial intelligence, cloud computing, the blockchain or some other revolutionary technology as if those things were the Second Coming. Those people have no idea what they are talking about and just repeat talking points they picked up in short videos or other tidbit-sized formats that do not exceed their attention span of roughly seven seconds. They celebrate the detoriation of our concentration as it were something useful and not a sign of our coming demise.
