## Initial Idea

Adapted from [How to Learn Rust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hXNd6x9sZs)

1. Read a chapter of [The Rust Programming Language (2nd
   Edition)](https://nostarch.com/rust-programming-language-2nd-edition)
   quickly.
2. Read the same chapter in the enhanced Brown University version of [The Rust
   Programming Language](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/title-page.html) and do
   the quizzes.
3. Do the [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) up to the point
   you lack the theoretical foundation.
4. Try to do some [Exercises for
   Programmers](https://pragprog.com/titles/bhwb/exercises-for-programmers/)
   with the knowledge acquired.
5. Repeat.
